# VirtualDigitalHuman_WorkReport(正在完善中)
This is a work report repository about Virtual Digital Human, including 3D Human Head, 3D Human Bodies, 3D Human Motions, 3D Human Textures, and 3D Virtual Tryon. <br/>
I have compiled the research results into the work report in PDF format, PDF can be found [here](VirtualDigitalHuman_WorkReport.pdf).<br/>
All materials provided by this repository, including MP4, GIF, PDF, JPG, have also been put on [pan.baidu.com](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DAcX4ngI5wYj3Ad_goTp4w?pwd=7y69)<br/>

This repository mainly contains two demos, as well as their implementation details and pipelines

## Demo1 : 3D Virtual Tryon
Try on various clothes to different postures and shapes of body models, and replace their heads with Flames (with facial emotions). <br/>
Finally, the 3D virtual human with voice broadcast is generated.<br/>
The GIF of the final results and the implementation process are shown below:<br/>
(MP4 with sound of the final results, please download the [3DVirtualTryon.mp4](3DVirtualTryon.mp4) and [3DVirtualTryonTurn.mp4](3DVirtualTryonTurn.mp4). )
( They are also included in the [pan.baidu.com](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DAcX4ngI5wYj3Ad_goTp4w?pwd=7y69) )
